The Blender NIF Plugin enables Blender to import and export NIF files.

This is a fork of the official blender nif tools:
`https://github.com/niftools/blender_nif_plugin`

The master branch of this repository is based on the "develop" branch of upstream which is why
it appears to be so far ahead.

I am improving the exporters for Fallout 3 and New Vegas in Blender 2.79b.
In the future I may look at Skyrim and Fallout 4, and also Blender 2.80 support.
I'm not interested in other games but I try not to break them with my changes.

There is no official release of this fork.  When F3 is a decent state I may
prepare a release focused on that.
